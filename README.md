# Tracker

## What is it???
This is our Android Studio app that will help track estrogen doses for feminizing HRT.

It is our entry for the UAH 2025 ACM Hackathon.

## How can I use it?
Right now it is a work in progress.
When we get closer to a working state, we will add more details as to how to get this working for you.

### Disclaimer!
This app is a general guide when it comes to estrogen levels. Don't rely on it for personal hormone levels, use blood work for that!

Estresso, derived from [estrannaise](https://estrannai.se/), is designed to give you an idea of what your levels are and show you where you are in your cycle. Estrogen levels vary greatly between individuals, so take these levels with a grain of salt!
